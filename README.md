Haversine Formula
====

The idea is: I'm playing the virtual Volvo Ocean Race. I get
coordinates sort of like 40 N 45' 35" - 002 E 51' 41". I want to
figure out the fastest [range of] heading[s] from one pair of
coordinates to another. I'd rather enter it locally and with just
numbers.

Turns out it's kind of irrelevant because for real oceans, wind makes
a lot of difference.
